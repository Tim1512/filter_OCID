This is just a py27-qt4 program to filter the opencellid.org database into manageable pieces.

You can filter by lat/long and/or mcc/mnc/lac/cid.

The program takes in the initial csv file from opencellid.org (it's free) and creates a sqlite db.

You can create manageable-size dbs of certain areas, mcc's, etc. and output in kmz,csv, and sqlite.
